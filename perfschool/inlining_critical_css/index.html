    <main>
      <p>In this exercise you'll see a bunch of styles, images and whatnot.</p>
      <p>It's up to you to figure out which styles are critical, as in, what styles are needed to render the first view of the page?</p>
      <p>Those are the styles that are absolutely necessary at page load. The rest of the styles we can defer.</p>
      <p>In the <strong>"DEFER ALL THE THINGS"</strong> exercise we've already learned how to defer all of our styles.</p>
      <p>All that's needed besides that is to inline the rest of the styles. The ones that actually matter. So that the page doesn't flicker at page load, but it doesn't load all the unnecessary and expensive styles either.</p>
      <p>Styles are typically not big enough for this to matter, except that blocking rendering is expensive because you could be showing the page to the user hundreds of milliseconds earlier.</p>
      <h2>Why any of this matters?</h2>
      <p>It's all about the user experience.</p>
      <h2>Says who?</h2>
      <p>Well, UX and performance are actually very closely intertwined. Studies show that performance is closely related to business metrics and that poor performance can have a devastating impact on sales. Users quickly lose interest in slow products</p>
      <h2>What else?</h2>
      <p>Well, I'm terribly tired of typing, so I'll come up with weird markup next just to have an excuse for unused styles and whatnot!</p>
      <h3>Cool!</h3>
      <div class='eff'>This is a cool piece of software.</div>
      <div class='esp'>Especially because I wrote it. Sometimes that reminds me, people build the web. We're like artisans. Except better, artisans don't have the <em>Internet</em>.</div>
      <h3>See, this is where we can really shine.</h3>
      <p>Have you ever seen something that fast?</p>
      <p>Like, ridiculously fast.</p>
      <p>Why do people even do stuff like this?</p>
      <p>I don't know. I just have a lot of spare time.</p>
      <p>Or maybe somebody paid me to do it. I guess we'll never know the truth behind it.</p>
      <h3>But really, it's about the people!</h3>
      <p>I'm getting very philosophical here.</p>
      <p>I seriously can't think of anything else to write.</p>
      <p>Lorem Ipsum would be tasty, but this has gone too far now.</p>
      <p>I can't just throw Lorem Ipsum here. That ship has sailed hundreds of words ago.</p>
      <h3>Fine, one more charade</h3>
      <div class='bored'>Boredom can do dangerous things to people. Are you insured against boredom? That should be a thing.</div>
